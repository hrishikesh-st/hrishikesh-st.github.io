I am a masters student in <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering">Robotics Engineering Program</a> at <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/">Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)</a>. I'm a Graduate Student Researcher at the <b><a href="https://wp.wpi.edu/merlab/">Manipulation and Environmental Robotics Lab</a></b>, where I'm developing novel approaches to rearrange the waste pile in recycling plants for efficient robotic waste sorting. This project involves using depth images and point clouds to manipulate the waste stream using a robotic arm, and uncover occluded and covered objects.

Prior to grad school I spent 3 amazing years at <a href="https://www.adagrad.ai/"> Adagrad AI </a>, a fast paced startup, delivering production-grade Computer Vision solutions for global clients. I was involved in solving challenges in real-time video analytics, such as OCR, license plate recognition, pose estimation, person fall detection, and semantic segmentation.
